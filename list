Usage: rhc cartridge <action>

Cartridges add functionality to OpenShift applications.  Each
application has one web cartridge to listen for HTTP requests, and any
number of addon cartridges.  Addons may include databases like MySQL and
Mongo, administrative tools like phpMyAdmin, or build clients like
Jenkins.

Most cartridges that listen for incoming network traffic are placed on
one or more gears (a small server instance).  Other cartridges may be
available across all of the gears of an application to listen for
changes (like Jenkins) or provide environment variables.

Use the 'cartridges' command to see a list of all available cartridges.
Add a new cartridge to your application with 'add-cartridge'. OpenShift
also supports downloading cartridges - pass a URL in place of the
cartridge name and we'll download and install that cartridge into your
app.  Keep in mind that these cartridges receive no security updates.
Note that not all OpenShift servers allow downloaded cartridges.

For scalable applications, use the 'cartridge-scale' command on the web
cartridge to set the minimum and maximum scale.

Commands that affect a cartridge within an application will affect all
gears the cartridge is installed to.
